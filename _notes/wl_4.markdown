Man I didn't realise how tough this was gonna be when I started out

Day 1 ->

- Spent most of the day studying and working on AI Agents
- Started a blog on AI agents
- Did some studying on diffusion models.

Day 2 ->

- I spent most of the day reading about AI agents in the morning, then was on a call with a colleague discussing how we can implement said agents and ideas
- I spent the evening reading more on the complex mathematical idea behind diffusion models and really really grok it. It took time but I understand 1 equation now. The forward diffusion process. I also wrote what I understood in my blog. It is still a work in progress but I would like to get it done with within this month.
- I then spent my night reading blogs by chip, they are really beautiful and friendly imo. [link](https://huyenchip.com/)

Day 3 ->

- Morning went as usual, work & meetings.
- Today I got done with my driving classes which is nice
- In the evening I created some visualizations for my diffusion model blog

Day 4 ->

- copy paste above morning routine
- In the evening I added more content for the diffusion blog
- I woke up at 4 to start writing a guide on ml maths. That was nice.

Day 5 ->

- I got done with UNETs which is pretty nice
- It's ;ate at night and I am watching a movie (3 billboards outside ebbing,misouri)

Day 6 ->

- I do enjoy weekends a lot, not because I don't have work. But because I can put more hours learning things on my own.
- Today I released my second youtube video, Understanding Positional Encoding. I plan to release the one on RoPE next week.
- I started learning about shaders and animation in the afternoon because I really want to create pizza. A library which is like manim, but looks like excalidraw.
- In the evening I worked on the blog. I didnt get much done here, but I did sure understand a lot of things clearer.
- I really want to get a majority portion of the blog done tomorrow. I think if I have each section written down first. Then I can work on the visuals, after which I can work on the code. If I finish the writing of sections tomorrow. I can hopefully wrap everything up this month.
- I also learnt about the 12 rules of animation, and started reading the book on shadders. They pretty dope.
