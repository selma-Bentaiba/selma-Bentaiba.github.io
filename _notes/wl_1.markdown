This is just a random collection of things I learned on a daily basis of the week, It is really unstructured. Filled with random lessons and thoughts. 
I am mostly writing this as a memoir for my future self, and as a way to keep track of my day to day activities.

I doubt it will make much sense to you, but feel free to have a look. 

Day 1 -> 
Workout routine 
Start driving 
publish transformers blog 
Food diet  

Day 2 
- I tried making the youtube video for transformers. I will do it again tomorrow, with a script or some pointers in hand. That will be better
- added google analytics, comments, share buttons and socials to the blog, also update my socials. (Used Cursor to do it, write a bit about that). I reorganized the blog as well. 
- Add workout routine and diet.
- Ordered protein (write about how to pick the best one and different kinds)
- Finished 48 laws of power, The most important laws to me 
    - Law 4 -> Always say less than necessary (this keeps things open ended, vague. People think of their on interpretations.)
    - Law 9 -> Win through actions never through words 
    - Law 10 -> Infection: Avoid the unhappy and unlucky 
    - Law 13 -> When asking for help, Appeal to people's self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude 
    - Law 16 -> Use Absence to increase respect and honor 
    - Law 20 -> Do not commit to anyone 
    - Law 21 -> Play a sucker to catch a sucker - Seem dumber than your mark (it takes great skill and knowledge, to conceal one's skill and knowledge)
    - Law 25 -> Re-Create yourself 
    - law 28 -> Enter Actions with boldness 
    - Law 29 -> Plan all the way to the end 
    - Law 30 -> Make your accomplishments seem effortless 
    - Law 34 -> Be royal in your fashion: Act like a kind to be treated like one 
    - Law 36 -> Disdain things you cannot have: ignoring them is the best revenge 
    - Law 40 -> Despise the free lunch 
    - Law 44 -> Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect 
    - Law 48 -> Assume formlessness 
    Control your emotions, do not be affected by anything. Because when someone finds out they have hit a nerve they will strike there.

    - U don't have a marketing problem, u have a shitty problem

- I also started with looking into OBS studio a bit, so it has some amazing plugins that you can add. I have added masked plugin (to make my camera output border look better ) and move, to improve transitions. 
Also a shortcut for smooth zoom. 

Day 4 
- I spent most of the day using manim, trying to create a short introduction video to self-attention 
- I spent rest of the day having with a few friends 
- I also did start reading e-myth revistied. It is a pretty fun book so far, striaghtforward and story based. The way I like my non-fiction to be, a bit fictional haha.
