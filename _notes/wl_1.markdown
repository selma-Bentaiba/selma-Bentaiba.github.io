Day 2 
- I tried making the youtube video for transformers. I will do it again tomorrow, with a script or some pointers in hand. That will be better

- Add workout routine and diet.
- Ordered protein (write about how to pick the best one and different kinds)
- Finished 48 laws of power, The most important laws to me 
    - Law 4 -> Always say less than necessary (this keeps things open ended, vague. People think of their on interpretations.)
    - Law 9 -> Win through actions never through words 
    - Law 10 -> Infection: Avoid the unhappy and unlucky 
    - Law 13 -> When asking for help, Appeal to people's self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude 
    - Law 16 -> Use Absence to increase respect and honor 
    - Law 20 -> Do not commit to anyone 
    - Law 21 -> Play a sucker to catch a sucker - Seem dumber than your mark (it takes great skill and knowledge, to conceal one's skill and knowledge)
    - Law 25 -> Re-Create yourself 
    - law 28 -> Enter Actions with boldness 
    - Law 29 -> Plan all the way to the end 
    - Law 30 -> Make your accomplishments seem effortless 
    - Law 34 -> Be royal in your fashion: Act like a kind to be treated like one 
    - Law 36 -> Disdain things you cannot have: ignoring them is the best revenge 
    - Law 40 -> Despise the free lunch 
    - Law 44 -> Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect 
    - Law 48 -> Assume formlessness 
    Control your emotions, do not be affected by anything. Because when someone finds out they have hit a nerve they will strike there.
