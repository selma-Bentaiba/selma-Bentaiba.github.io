Day 1 ->

Today was a different day to say the least I did my company work in the morning, and started working on the blog in the evening. But at 6 I got a call from a friend. Who had shifted to my town 6 months ago but never contacted me. 

He needed help (most of the times people call me for help and I am more than happy to abide)

After that, I went to his place. We had a lot of fun, I am glad for today. 

Day 2 ->

More progress was made in the blog, Diffusion models are pure magic imo. The geniuses who came up with the reverse diffusion process should be revered too. 
Well consider reading it when it's out. 

Also I got a text from another friend in the morning, surpringingly she had the same problem as my previous friend who called me yesterday. 

I seem to often see this pattern in people my age. Unfortunate really.
