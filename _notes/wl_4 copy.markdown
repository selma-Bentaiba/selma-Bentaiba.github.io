Day 2 ->

- I spent most of the day reading about AI agents in the morning, then was on a call with a colleague discussing how we can implement said agents and ideas
- I spent the evening reading more on the complex mathematical idea behind diffusion models and really really grok it. It took time but I understand 1 equation now. The forward diffusion process. I also wrote what I understood in my blog. It is still a work in progress but I would like to get it done with within this month.
- I then spent my night reading blogs by chip, they are really beautiful and friendly imo. [link](https://huyenchip.com/)
