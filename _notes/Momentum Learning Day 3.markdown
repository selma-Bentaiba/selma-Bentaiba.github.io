 # Day 3| Momentum Learning Series


Today I studied just a little, but I kept the streak alive.

I went through [MemGPT (arxiv: 2310.08560)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08560), along with the course *LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory*.

### Key Ideas

* The **context window** holds the most important information.
* **Archival memory** â†’ for general-purpose data.
* **Recall memory** â†’ for old message history.
* Both archival and recall memory keep **statistics** for tracking and management.

Small step, but progress is progress.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note to myself:** studying in the **morning** works best. Donâ€™t push it to late afternoons, finish it as early as possible.
