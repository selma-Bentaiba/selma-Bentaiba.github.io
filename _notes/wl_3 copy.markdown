Man I didn't realise how tough this was gonna be when I started out 

Day 1 -> 
- Spent most of the day studying and working on AI Agents 
- Started a blog on AI agents 
- Did some studying on diffusion models.  
  
Day 2 -> 
- I spent most of the day reading about AI agents in the morning, then was on a call with a colleague discussing how we can implement said agents and ideas 
- I spent the evening reading more on the complex mathematical idea behind diffusion models and really really grok it. It took time but I understand 1 equation now. The forward diffusion process. I also wrote what I understood in my blog. It is still a work in progress but I would like to get it done with within this month. 
- I then spent my night reading blogs by chip, they are really beautiful and friendly imo. [link](https://huyenchip.com/)

Day 3 ->
- Morning went as usual, work & meetings. 
- Today I got done with my driving classes which is nice
- In the evening I created some visualizations for my diffusion model blog

Day 4 -> 
- copy paste above morning routine 
- In the evening I added more content for the diffusion blog
- I woke up at 4 to start writing a guide on ml maths. That was nice.
