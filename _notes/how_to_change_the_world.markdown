Before we talk about how to change the world, let us ask ourselves. Why do you want to change the world?

"The world has been the way it is way before you were born, and will stay the same way if you do or do not do anything about it.
How dare you even have the audacity to think that you deserve to change the world, The world is absolutely perfect. And if it is not perfect, Let some other messiah.. GOD take care of it"

I do not hope to solve poverty, I do not hope to solve global warming, I do not hope to solve loneliness (But hopefully inspire you to).
That is not "The world" for me."The world" to me is a place of wishful thinkers and lost souls.
People who can acheive so much more than what they think, but do not know what to do.
That is "the world" that I hope to change.

So Why change the world? So the world can have more dreamers, who have faith and direction in their dreams. 

## Write; you are not as smart as you think

## Read; you do not have all the answers

## Dream; You are limited by your imagination 

## Build; Great ideas make others go "I could have thought of that"

## Question... Everything
