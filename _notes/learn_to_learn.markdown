[A WORK IN PROGRESS] Learning is something we do everyday, but have you ever tried learning how to learn?

That seems like a strange question to ask, until you start pondering over it. 
Think of it in terms of an optimization problem, we try to optimize our lifts in the gym, we try to optimize the way we spend our money, we try to optimize our time. Logically; Why can't we optimize our learning. 

It is well known that everyone has their own way of learning, but there are a few tricks/tactics that everyone can greatly benefit from, here is a collection of few such tips. That I have gathered from courses, books, article and personal experiences. 

## Open Mind; If you think you can't do it, you can't do it

"In 1939, a misunderstanding brought about surprising results. Near the beginning of a class, Professor Neyman wrote two problems on the blackboard. Dantzig arrived late and assumed that they were a homework assignment. According to Dantzig, they "seemed to be a little harder than usual", but a few days later he handed in completed solutions for both problems, still believing that they were an assignment that was overdue. Six weeks later, an excited Neyman eagerly told him that the "homework" problems he had solved were two of the most famous unsolved problems in statistics."[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dantzig)



## Gather; Find all the resources on the topic you possibly can

## Experiment; Try everything that you possibly can 

## Progressive overload; if it's not hard, you are not learning 

## SMART; Specific Measurable Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound

## Enjoy; What's the point if you are not having fun -->
