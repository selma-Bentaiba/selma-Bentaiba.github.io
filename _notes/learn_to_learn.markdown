[A WORK IN PROGRESS] Learning is something we do everyday, but have you ever tried learning how to learn?

That seems like a strange question to ask, until you start pondering over it. 
Think of it in terms of an optimization problem, we try to optimize our lifts in the gym, we try to optimize the way we spend our money, we try to optimize our time. Logically; Why can't we optimize our learning. 

It is well known that everyone has their own way of learning, but there are a few tricks/tactics that everyone can greatly benefit from, here is a collection of few such tips. That I have gathered from courses, books, article and personal experiences. 

## Open Mind; If you think you can't do it, you can't do it

## Gather; Find all the resources on the topic you possibly can

## Experiment; Try everything that you possibly can 

## Progressive overload; if it's not hard, you are not learning 

## SMART; Specific Measuable Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound

## Enjoy; What's the point if you are not having fun
