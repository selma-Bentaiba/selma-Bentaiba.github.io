Day 1 -> 
- Most of the day was spent working for the company, I had a look at onyx. It is an interesting project and highly relevant to what I am working on 
- For the time I had left I worked on manim and the youtube video. A lot of time was spent getting it just perfect
- In any free time I got, I continued reading the e myth revisited, it is a rather nice book. It brought to light an issue I had been facing with my own company that I started with my friends.  

Day 2 ->
- I worked on manim, I made 4 minutes of my transformers video. But I want it to be just perfect 
- I read the boo
- I started working on the SD blog, damn is it challenging. But completely worth it IMO.
