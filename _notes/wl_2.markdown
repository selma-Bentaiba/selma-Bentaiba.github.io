Day 1 -> 
- Most of the day was spent working for the company, I had a look at onyx. It is an interesting project and highly relevant to what I am working on 
- For the time I had left I worked on manim and the youtube video. A lot of time was spent getting it just perfect
- In any free time I got, I continued reading the e myth revisited, it is a rather nice book. It brought to light an issue I had been facing with my own company that I started with my friends.  

Day 2 ->
- I worked on manim, I made 4 minutes of my transformers video. But I want it to be just perfect 
- I read the boo
- I started working on the SD blog, damn is it challenging. But completely worth it IMO.

day 3 -> 
- Something that has stuck with me for a long time are the two things I read on "The millionaire fastlane"
    - First being "impact millions' That is the autour saying. "If I had to sum the entire book in 2 words"
    - Second, The CENTS formula. It goes lik 
        - C -> Control, You should have entire control of your business, you cannot delegate this. 
        - E -> Entry, THe entry barrier should be relatively high. Otherwise everyone will be doing it. 
        - N -> Need, Their should be a cutomer base who you can provide value to, if your business does not solve a need. It wont succeed. 
        - T -> Time, You are not your business, you should be able to detach your time from the business. Otherwise you will have a job not a business. The end goal should be you spending as less time as possible in your own business 
        - S -> Scale, Your business should be scalable. You can be the best nurse in the world. But you can only cater to a handful of people in your entire life 
- Also, let us speak a bit about the other books and podcasts that have stuck with me. 
    - The almanack of naval ravikant, "You need 7 years of dedication that's all" Pick something. DO it to the entireity for 7 years. THat is all you need. 
    - Perplexity is not the competitor of google, their motto is "knowledge" It's an entirely different business model 
    - To overtake an existing product. Your product needs to be either 10x UI better, UX better or anything that is 10X (from hooked book)
    - Most of the times, doing things which are 10x just need 2x of the energy. 
    - Also I was reading on Charlie Munger's speach and ideas.
        - INVERT INVERT INVERT, if you have a problem you cant figure out. Try thinking of it in other ways. 
        - Just sit down and do not get up till its done. 
    - Some thoughts from paul's blogs have also stuck with me. THe most profound one being. Inconvience, founders just have a keen eye for the most weirdly inconvinient things that people have just accepted to live with. They are so used to it being the way it is, noone ever thinks of chaning or improving it. 
- Some more sayings that I like 
    - The way one does one thing, he does everything. 
    - If you do it once, you will do it again. 
- I also learned that these three line are live savers 
```
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

day 4:
- I was mostly busy with work today 
- The time I did get I spent learning about GANs, from the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661) and [blog](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2017-08-20-gan/)
I also found an interesting youtube channel, that had a great video on markov chains. It was called normalized nerds hahaha. 
- I read some interesting things from e-myth revisited which I would like to write about in one go. 
- It's late.... I really want to sleep. But I must learn.. I want to know more. I am reading these [blogs](https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/3/19/expectation-and-variance-from-high-school-to-grad-school) atm, really got inspired by Taehoon Kim's [story](https://carpedm30.notion.site/me)
