## First week review :>


Itâ€™s been three weeks since I started this blog.
I was so excited to post about anything and everything ... 
writing about what I learned, what I plan to learn, and sharing my experiences on various topics. 

But here I am, paralyzed by the need to make everything "perfect." 

This kind of thinking keeps recurring in my life, stopping me from doing the things I truly want to do.
Mostly, itâ€™s because I fear doing it wrong or not having enough to talk about (even though Iâ€™ve already written a list of dozens of topics I could write about). 

I feel like I don't know how to start this..



But guess what? Iâ€™ll never know unless I give it a shot.
A first start, just one tiny step.

So, on the night of March 16th (also the 16th of Ramadan), I decided: *"Hey, letâ€™s write the first weekly update."*


Iâ€™ve always wanted to have a blog to write about tech and my learning journey. 

One of the things Iâ€™ve wanted to do most is **weekly learning updates** â€” basically, writing about what I did during the week in a nutshell, 
focusing on the learning aspects, the obstacles I faced, and how I can improve.

I was inspired by various blogs, like Ali Abdaalâ€™s weekly life notes.

So, letâ€™s get started!

### Reflecting on the First Quarter Goals

Last week, I reviewed my progress on my first-quarter goals and realized a few things:

- **Lack of Daily Monitoring**: Sometimes, I set weekly goals and try to break them into daily tasks, but this wasnâ€™t efficient.
I wasnâ€™t tracking my habits, time, or daily accomplishmentsâ€”especially with the start of Ramadan and the change in schedule.
Time just flies by.  

  So, this week, I started doing daily reviews and writing down the details of my day.

- **Destroying Perfectionism**: I need to adopt a *"Bad First Draft"* mentality. _And here we are, doing just that._

- **Slow Progress on ML Course**: Itâ€™s been months since I started the ML specialization course, but my progress has been super slow due to inconsistency.  
  What I did: I reintroduced the ML course as a daily habit (20 minutes every day).
  And guess what? I finally finished the unit I was stuck on!

My mission for this week was: **"Keep the Momentum Alive."**

### What I Did This Week


#### 1. **Neural Networks Deep Dive**
I tried to tackle neural networks and get a deeper understanding of them.
Last year, I started learning about ML, DL, and LLMs for my Bachelorâ€™s final project,
but I realized there were many gaps in my knowledge.
This became clear during a college module called *"Machine Learning and Neural Networks."*

I read a few articles on backpropagation and NNs:
- [Neural Networks Intuitively and Exhaustively](https://iaee.substack.com/p/neural-networks-intuitively-and-exhaustively)
- [Backpropagation Explained](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/)

Along with that, I practiced implementing neural networks.

#### 2. **Spirituality and Islam**
I took notes on two videos about Ramadan and *CHANGE* by Ahmed Abd al Monim.
They were very useful and served as fuel for the start of the week:

- [Video 1](https://youtu.be/pr7EzlgP2BM?si=SmxJPG1Xq9ubHtBL)
- [Video 2](https://youtu.be/L4Wovp92Zpo?si=BsCXP5IOi1n2Q1QV)


#### 3. **Game Design Document**
I created a Game Design Document for my college module, *"CJRV: Game Development and Virtual Reality."* 

It was challenging to think of how to design a game with limited VR aspects, but it was fun diving into this.
Itâ€™s literally my beginning in game development.  
*(PS: Stay tuned for me learning Blender and Unity!)*


#### 4. **College TPs**
Some days this week, I felt super unmotivated to attend college TPs (practical work sessions).
I skipped some, not gonna lie, while focusing on others. 
Iâ€™m not sure if this was a good idea, but I was certainly overwhelmed. *(To give you context, we have 7 TPs â€” not trying to make excuses, but yeah, I am.)*

#### 5. **Energy and Time Management**
It was hard to balance my energy this week, especially with sleeping and learning times. 
Most of the week went into college homework.


#### 6. **Data Mining TP**
I worked on a Data Mining TP, which was like a mini-research project. 
We tried to improve the **Apriori Algorithm**. 
I mainly used statistical methods and evaluation metrics, which the professor liked. *(Phew! Heâ€™s a very precise prof.)*

#### 7. **Group Reading Sessions**
I spent a good amount of time this week on group reading sessions for *Muqaddimah Ibn Khaldun* (Ù…Ù‚Ø¯Ù‘Ù…Ø© Ø§Ø¨Ù† Ø®Ù„Ø¯ÙˆÙ†).
I was invested on these sessions, though I feel some guilt because they take up more time than Iâ€™d like.

#### 8. **Weekend Slackiness**
I realized that the last two weekends, Iâ€™ve been super slacky. 
But I guess itâ€™s good sometimes to focus only on family during weekends.

#### 9. **Reading *Al-Naba' Al-Adheem* (Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø¨Ø£ Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø¸ÙŠÙ…)**
I started reading a book on the greatness of the Quran called *Al-Naba' Al-Adheem*. 
Since this is the month of Ramadan, itâ€™s a great time to listen to Tafseer and learn more about the Quran.

### Big Takeaway of the Week  
**ðŸ“› All types of actions carry momentum. It can be good or bad.**

Though this week was full of things, I do realize I need more delibrate work specially on the technical aspect .
