Day 1 -> 
- Went to kolkata with sister 
- Was doing company work most of the day
- Watched a good movie "The invisible guest"

Day 2 ->
- Spent time doing company work 
- Had a meeting about how to run our business with friends 
- Still studying about VAEs 
- Started with the video on positional encoding

Day 3 -> 
- I find it funny, I started this as a way to track everything that I am learning day to day. But surprisingly, its only a few hours of the day when I learn something new, sometimes miniscule minutes. Only few days of the week when I learn something new. 
Learning follows a bell curve, the tails being not learning anything at all and learning a lot in a short time (this will be a test imo haha) and most of the times, its just general learning (or I will call experience, doing the same thing everyday, you do improve at it. Even if by a small amount)
- Today I spent most of the day working 
- Then reading the E myth book, some papers, some code for positional encoding

Day 4 -> 
- I came to my old home for my brother's engagement, most of my day was spent on that.  I'm a Marwadi and we have one of craziest weddings in the world. Majority of money we make, is spent on weddings and education. millions in fact. It's nice, it's crazy. 
I believe I have different views to marriage than the people in my community, I believe in love before marriage rather than the other way around. 
Even when the world and experiences tell me otherwise, I believe true love is real.

Day 5 -> 
- I was back home, spent most of the day working. 
- I noticed my grandma's hands shaking when serving me food today. My heart sank. 

Day 6 -> 
- I mostly worked on the youtube video 
- In the evening I binged solo-leveling 

Day 7 -> 
- I got done with the youtube video, but didn't publish it as I have to add my voice over
