"AI is the new Electrictiy" - Andrew Ng

This is one of the first sentences that really stuck with me when I started out college and saw a video about AI for the first time (it was shared by a senior), This blog is mostly a recollection of how I started out with ML with a tad bit of my personal history and an intro to the indian culture towards education.\ 

Also a bit about how most people see education in india as, my views on this matter are pretty harsh and rough. But they are my own opinion, as the saying goes "india is not for beginners". Most people here come from a background where affording 3 meals a day is a big deal, taking that into consideration most of the choices made by the people in the story I am about to tell makes sense. 

Try not to be smug, people live the way they live because that helps them survive. If they knew better, we wouldn't be where we are. 

# To be or not be 

Like all good stories my journey begins with a dilemma, The dilemma of choosing medical or engineering. 

For most people in india as soon as their high school gets over they have to choose either; as they are one of the highest paying jobs in the country. 

I initially wanted to do medical (Oh lord I am so happy I didn't!!!) reason being I was really fascinated by how our mind worked, and was really getting into neuro sciences, psychology, Philosophical contcepts of nature vs nurture. 

But I decided against it, because someone told me medical has no mathematics, and I just couldn't imagine a life without spending a majority of it learning and working with mathematics. (We had a saying in highschool "I will marry a girl if she could do an integration in front of me" it was mostly an inside joke, as we saw integration as the most beautiful thing in the world)

So I decided to join the rat race called JEE 

## JEE ne do na (Let me live)

JEE stands for Joint Entrance Examination, it is a test that is conducted nationwide. With approximately 1.5 millions kids giving it. Out of which only 10k are ever selected to be allowed a seat in the most prestigious colleges of india. 
(YEP, it is insane, it's tough. People literally kill themselves over this examination because it is such a big deal)

I never really cared about being an IITian initially (Being an IITian is such a big deal in india, you can basically marry most women, Ask for insane dowry; yes the criminal act, Get good jobs; not anymore but yeh), as most of my life so far I was pretty much able to achieve whatever I wanted to achieve pretty easily. 

A few months went by and I still failed misserably at the mock tests, I started realising that their were harder problems still in life left. So I started giving it my all and started studying for JEE. 

We used to talk about how we would kill ourselves if we don't make it (Seriously, this examination is not healthy. Noone should do it). After 2.5 (COVID extended our exams) grueling years I got into NITR (which is like the 2nd best thing after an IIT).

Now JEE taught me a lot about myself, That I am really disciplied, that I can acheive a lot of things if I put my heart and soul into it, that their are amazing problems in the world to solve. (JEE is just lots of tough physics, chem and maths problems)

## I want it world 

It was a crazy new world, And I wanted to try it all. {add story of how you felt when you came to college for the first time, seniors, friends, clubs etc}

I started out with web development, I had done a bit of it back in 8th grade. But I found it extremely boring. Like dude the heck is a flex box and why do I need to align it so exactly. I didn't spend a lot of time on it and stopped after 2 months. (I mostly used freecodecamp)

After which I went into mobile dev, which just felt like web dev but slower. My laptop basivally died after trying to run kotlin, I did that for a few weeks then moved on to Competitive Programming. 

Now this was fun, if you have never heard of CP. In this you are basically given a very tough problem that you have to solve using code and optimize it to be as fast as possible. This felt like JEE (I actually enjoyed the grind of JEE and was missing the tough grueling feeling and the joy of solving problem) which made me really angry and happy. I did this for 6 months, but then I thought about my future in this, I didn't really want to solve problems for the sake of solving problems. 

I wanted to build cool stuff as well, by this time I had met a lot of people in college and saw that they were building real life solutions, software, robots and I wanted to be a part of that. 

So I started attending webinars
