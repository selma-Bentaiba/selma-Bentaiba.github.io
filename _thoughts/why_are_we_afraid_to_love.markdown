[A work in progress] Better to hurt than be hurt. 

I am 21 years old today, my idea of love is most likely deeply flawed and naive. That is pricisely why I must write about it now. Because these feelings that I feel, these ideas, my expression of love. Will only continue to grow and change significantly with time. 

I want to capture my thoughts on this ever growing, ever changing, forever the reason for most people's growth.

# Our first experience with love 

Most of us feel something that we call love since we are born, the love of parents, the love of a family, the love of friends. But the romantic kind, not sexual. But romantic, the kind we envision spending a lot of our time with someone, and that someone alone. To share our laughs, sorrow and valued time with. 
Because nothing brings more joy than the idea of being with that person. 

This kind of romantic love is encountered in a pretty young age I believe, even before we have an idea of sex. At an age of perhaps 12-16.

These ideas are based on personal experience, the experiences of people around me and from the media I grew up consuming. Your idea of first love may be entirely different and I respect that. I am also a man, and I have been told at young age women mature faster then men. So again my believes may still be very naive to even people my age. 

This romantic love can end in two ways in my opinion
* the person reciprocates your feelings 
* the person does not reciprocate your feelings 

Lets talk about both

# The inevitable future 

# The first heartbreak
