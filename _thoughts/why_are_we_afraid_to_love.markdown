"In the ideal world there exists only one being, and when put on earth that is split into a man and a female. Most of life is finding that other half of you. And that is love" - plato {correct this as this is not the exact quote}

I am 21 years old today, my idea of love is most likely deeply flawed and naive. That is pricisely why I must write about it now. Because these feelings that I feel, these ideas, my expression of love. Will only continue to grow and change significantly with time. 

I want to capture my thoughts on this ever growing, ever changing, forever the reason for most people's growth.

# Our first experience with love 

Most of us feel something that we call love since we are born, the love of parents, the love of a family, the love of friends. But the romantic kind, not sexual. But romantic, the kind we envision spending a lot of our time with someone, and that someone alone. To share our laughs, sorrow and valued time with. 
Because nothing brings more joy than the idea of being with that person. 

This kind of romantic love is encountered in a pretty young age I believe, even before we have an idea of sex. At an age of perhaps 12-16.

These ideas are based on personal experience, the experiences of people around me and from the media I grew up consuming. Your idea of first love may be entirely different and I respect that. I am also a man, and I have been told at young age women mature faster then men. So again my believes may still be very naive to even people my age. 

This romantic love can end in two ways in my opinion
* the person reciprocates your feelings 
* the person does not reciprocate your feelings 

Lets talk about both

# The inevitable future 

"I love you too" These words are magic, the world slows down, the past doesn't matter, there is no future, there is just this moment. This moment of bliss and the feeling that in this whole wide huge world, this enormous lonely unforgiving world. There is someone who sees something in you and cares about if you slept ok, cares if you had your food, cares if you stub your toe. 
cares for you.

What now? It doesn't matter. Because this moment could not be more perfect. So you guys start hanging out more, sharing about each other more. Move about the world, but still stay connected. And in the most unlikely scenario do not forget to love each other. 
And you truly were the perfect ones for each other, marry, have kids, get old, die together. 

But the world is not ideal, people are not perfect, maybe you do not like the way he chews his food, maybe you do not like the way she folds her sheets or doesn't fold her sheets, These issues continue to build over time till you cannot bear the sight of each other. (There is saying that I hate and like, "Everyone is a potential prospect till you know nothing about them")
Or it is just one sided, the other person has bigger dreams, wants more, isn't satisfied. It's almost like they have changed and are not the same person you fell in love with; surprising as it may seem, people are not the same at the age of 20 as they were when they were 15.

And that is when the inevitable happens


# The first heartbreak


Better to hurt than be hurt.
