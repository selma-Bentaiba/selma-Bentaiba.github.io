## Linear Algebra 

### Vectors

Different disciplines have different definition of a vector, but as this is maths for ml. We will primarily follow the mathematical definition. That being, a vector is something that follows the triangle law of addition 

### System of linear equations 

### Matrices 

##### Matrix Addition & multiplication 
Associativity, Distributivity, Multiplication with the identity matrix (types of matrices)

#### Inverse and Transpose

#### Multiplication by a Scalar

###  Solving Systems of Linear Equations

### Vector Space

### Linear Independence 

### Basis and Rank

### Linear Mappings 

### Affine spaces 


## Probability 


## Statistics 

## Geometry

### Norm
