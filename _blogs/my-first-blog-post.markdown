# Transformers Laid Out

I have encountered that there are mainly three types of blogs/videos/tutorials talking about transformers 

* Explaining how a transformer works (One of the best is [Jay Alammar's blog](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/))
* Explaining the "Attention is all you need" paper ([The Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/))
* Coding tranformers in PyTorch ([Coding a ChatGPT Like Transformer From Scratch in PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QSpl5nmrY))

And each follow an amazing pedigogy, Helping one understand a singluar concept from multiple point of views.

But this hindered my own learning process, hence I have created this blog. Which will do the following 

* Give an intition of how transformers work 
* Explain what each section of the paper means and how you can understand and implement it 
* Code it down using PyTorch from a beginners perspective

P.S All the code as well as assests can be accessed from my github and are free to use and distribute, Consider citing this work though :)
